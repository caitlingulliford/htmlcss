            <h1>Octopode</h1>
            <p>Octopuses are ocean creatures that are most famous for having eight arms and bulbous heads. Some other fun facts:
                They have three hearts and blue blood; they squirt ink to deter predators;
                and being boneless, they can squeeze into (or out of) tight spaces. They are quite intelligent and have been observed using tools.
